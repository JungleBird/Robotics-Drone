This is a repository for the flight controller routines I coded in C++ to run on an ATmega128 microcontroller. It's was a project I started some years ago and it's still an on-going project. 
The goal of this project was to design a drone that would demonstrate stable flight using only two rotors (instead of a traditional quad-rotor)

Early prototype of two-rotor drone

The idea was to use the battery as a counter-weight to balance out any shifting from the AC-motor's tilt/angle

The frame was constructed with a 3D printer. The stepper motors would control the AC motors tilt/angle and the battery would counter-rotate to cancel out changes in angular momentum
